##CUSTOM FEATURES FOR ISSUES:

##Updating status

  Issues w/ subfeatures/subtasks:
    Parent is "New" if all descendants are "New"
    "Closed" if all descendants are "Closed"
    "In-progress" if at least one descendant is niether "New" nor "Closed"

##Issue Relation

  Adding:
    Features: can only add Features/Tasks as subtasks.
    Bugs: can only add Bugs as subtasks.
    A subtask (Feature/Task/Bug), can only have 1 parent.
    Parent's status is automatically updated depending on the subtask's status. (see Updating status)

  Deleting subtasks or Issues with parent:
    Parent's status is automatically updated depending on the remaining subtasks' statuses.
    If all subtasks are deleted, Parent's status is automatically set to "New".
